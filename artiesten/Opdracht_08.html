<h2> the artist</h2>

<p>
Gazzy Garcia was born August 17, 2000 in Miami, Florida. When Garcia was 13 years old, his cousin introduced him to Omar Pineiro,
better known as Smokepurpp; the two eventually became collaborators.
Garcia and Piniero were expelled from multiple district schools. Garcia, thereafter,
enrolled in an opportunity high school but was expelled in the tenth grade for fighting and inciting a riot.[8]

<h2>his music</h2>
<p>
Garcia began 2017 by releasing the singles "D Rose" and "Boss", which were major hits on SoundCloud, collecting a combined 70 million streams.
The popularity of "D Rose" led to a music video being produced by Chicago based director Cole Bennett, also known as Lyrical Lemonade.
The music video was released on YouTube on January 30, 2017, and has gained 145 million views as of July 2018.
On June 9, 2017, Garcia signed a record deal with Tha Lights Global and Warner Bros.
Records, just two months before his seventeenth birthday.[14] However, in January 2018, Garcia's contract with Warner Bros.
Records was voided due to a technicality of his being a minor at the time of signing.[15]
In July 2017, Garcia announced through Twitter that his debut album was in the works and would be released in August.[16]
Although the album was not released in August it was pushed back and he instead released the song "Gucci Gang", which became his first Billboard Hot 100 entry,
peaking at number three on November 8, 2017.[17][18][6]
<br><br>
On October 6, 2017, he released his debut commercial studio album, Lil Pump, featuring Smokepurpp, Gucci Mane, Lil Yachty, Chief Keef, Rick Ross, and 2 Chainz.[19]
Garcia released "I Shyne" on January 18, 2018 with producer Carnage.[20] Following reports that Garcia had left his former label Warner Bros.
Records and the contract had been voided on the grounds of Garcia being a minor when he signed,[21] competition rose to sign Garcia with offers reportedly as high as $8 million[22] to $12 million or more,[23] and artists such as Gucci Mane and DJ Khaled
taking interest in Garcia.[24][25]
Garcia sparked rumors he had signed with Gucci Mane's imprint, 1017 Records, in February 2018.[26][27] Nonetheless, Garcia re-signed another contract with Warner Bros.
for $8 million on March 12, 2018.[28]
On April 13, 2018, Garcia released "Esskeetit", which debuted and peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100.
[6] In July 2018, he released the single "Drug Addicts" alongside a music video which features Charlie Sheen.[29]
